    <p>
        binjr is a time series browser; it renders time series data produced by other applications as dynamically
        editable representations and provides advanced features to navigate the data smoothly and efficiently
        (drag &amp; drop, zoom, history, detachable tabs, advanced time-range picker).
    </p>
    <p>
        It aims to be the missing link between the collection of disparate tools (text editors, graphing &amp;
        CLI utilities) traditionally used by developers to analyse forensic data locally and full-blown analytics
        platforms that centralize logs and telemetry for entire organizations.
